=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Game::Theory::TwoPersonMatrix> analyzes a two person matrix game of player
names, strategies and utilities ("payoffs").

Players 1 and 2 are the "row" and "column" players, respectively.  This is due
to the tabular format of a matrix game:

                  Player 2
                  --------
         Strategy 0.5  0.5
 Player |   0.5    1   -1  < Payoff
    1   |   0.5   -1    1  <

A non-zero sum game is represented by two payoff profiles, as in the SYNOPSIS.

A prisoner's dilemma, where Blue is the row player, Red is the column player,
and T > R > P > S is:

    \  Red |           |
      \    | Cooperate | Defect
 Blue   \  |           |
 --------------------------------
           | \   R2    | \   T2
 Cooperate |   \       |   \
           | R1  \     | S1  \
 --------------------------------
           | \   S2    | \   P2
 Defect    |   \       |   \
           | T1  \     | P1  \

And in this implementation that would be:

 $g = Game::Theory::TwoPersonMatrix->new(
    payoff1 => [ [ -1, -3 ], [  0, -2 ] ],  # Blue: [ R1, S1 ], [ T1, P1 ]
    payoff2 => [ [ -1,  0 ], [ -3, -2 ] ],  # Red:  [ R2, T2 ], [ S2, P2 ]
 );

Where the two player strategies are to either Cooperate or Defect.  This is
given by a hash for each of the two players:

 %strategy = (
    1 => { 1 => $cooporate1, 2 => $defect1 }, # Blue
    2 => { 1 => $cooporate2, 2 => $defect2 }, # Red
 );

See the F<eg/play> program in this distribution for an example that exercises
strategic variations of the prisoner's dilemma.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

 $g = Game::Theory::TwoPersonMatrix->new(
    1 => { 1 => 0.5, 2 => 0.5 },
    2 => { 1 => 0.5, 2 => 0.5 },
    payoff => [ [1,0],
                [0,1] ]
 );
 $g = Game::Theory::TwoPersonMatrix->new(
    payoff1 => [ [2,3],
                 [2,1] ],
    payoff2 => [ [3,5],
                 [2,3] ],
 );

Create a new C<Game::Theory::TwoPersonMatrix> object.

Player strategies are given by a hash reference of numbered keys - one for each
strategy.  Payoffs are given by array references of lists of outcomes.  For
zero-sum games this is a single payoff list.  For non-zero-sum games this is
given as two lists - one for each player.

Return a single outcome for a zero-sum game or a pair for a non-zero-sum game.

An optional list of player strategies can be provided.  This is a hashref of the
same type of strategies that are given to the constructor.
